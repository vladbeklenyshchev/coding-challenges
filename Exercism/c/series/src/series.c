        //  either a null pointer is returned, or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero value,
        //  except that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object.
        // So, calloc may return a null pointer for an allocation of zero bytes 
        // and passing a null pointer to memcpy is undefined behavior (even if Ã¬ts third argument is 0).
